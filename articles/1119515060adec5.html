				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>Three Democratic House members have asked Twitter&apos;s new owner and CEO, Elon Musk, to provide information about a possible &quot;platform manipulation campaign&quot; on the social media platform in recent weeks that &quot;restricted access to news about the People&apos;s Republic of China (PRC).&quot;</p><p>Reps. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and Jackie Speier, D-Calif., wrote to Musk on Tuesday, citing a Washington Post report that found many Chinese-language accounts began spamming Twitter with links to escort services and other offerings in the aftermath of protests over China&apos;s restrictive Covid control measures.</p><p>&quot;It is critical that we understand the extent of the PRC&apos;s potential manipulation of Twitter and identify how recent changes at Twitter are affecting the threat of CCP foreign influence operations on social media to ensure that the United States is prepared to counter, thwart, and deter foreign influence threats online,&quot; the lawmakers wrote.</p><p>They asked if Twitter had any evidence that the &quot;obstruction of access to Tweets&quot; about the protests was orchestrated by Beijing, and if it had evidence that any state actors had attempted to deliberately suppress access to information through bots or other manipulative tactics.</p><p>The lawmakers also inquired whether the platform is capable of detecting large-scale misinformation and information suppression campaigns, as well as what safeguards Twitter has in place to prevent attempts to restrict information access on its platform. They requested a response from Musk by the end of the year.</p><p>The letter comes after Musk, who is also the CEO of SpaceX, a US defense contractor, and Tesla, a multinational electric vehicle company with a vital factory in Shanghai, began releasing internal communications from Twitter to politically conservative writers such as Matt Taibbi and Bari Weiss this past week. Through his podcasting platform, Callin, Taibbi has an exclusive podcast deal with Musk&apos;s friend and Twitter investor David Sacks. Both Taibbi and Weiss publish newsletters on Substack, which is partially funded by Andreessen Horowitz, a Twitter co-investor with Musk.</p><p>Musk released what he claims is the first set of &quot;Twitter Files&quot; to back up claims that the company&apos;s previous management was biased against conservatives when it came to content moderation. Musk has even claimed that Twitter, which he now owns and runs, interfered with US elections. During a Twitter Spaces discussion, Musk suggested that more files about how Twitter handled the 2020 presidential election, the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the US Capitol, and the Covid-19 pandemic would be released.</p></span><br /></div>

				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>Prior to Musk&apos;s acquisition, research found that Twitter&apos;s content moderation approach was not politically biased, but the company did suspend tweets or accounts that shared widely accepted misinformation.</p><p>Twitter&apos;s former deputy general counsel, James Baker, &quot;was exited&quot; from the company this week, Musk said, due to &quot;concerns about Baker&apos;s possible role in suppressing information important to public discourse.&quot; Musk did not go into further detail.</p><p>According to Taibbi, Baker was involved in the review of the &quot;Twitter Files&quot; before they were given to him and Weiss.</p><p>Baker previously worked as a federal prosecutor and as the FBI&apos;s general counsel from 2014 to 2018. Former President Donald Trump claims the FBI &quot;spied&quot; on him.</p><p>During Baker&apos;s tenure, the FBI investigated Trump to determine whether he may have obstructed justice when he fired FBI Director James Comey in May 2017 and whether or how Russia had interfered in the U.S. electoral process leading to Trump becoming president.</p><p></span><br /></div>
