				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>On Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was named Time magazine&apos;s Person of the Year, after being one of ten individuals or groups shortlisted earlier this week.</p><p>Since late February, Zelensky has led Ukraine in its efforts to prevent a full-scale Russian invasion of the country, establishing the country as a world leader. He has presided over a string of victories in the war that have largely stalled Russia&apos;s advance and allowed Ukraine to reclaim captured territory.</p><p>The Ukrainian president, who was previously an actor who played the president in a television series, has become a regular fixture throughout the conflict, displaying a serious but reassuring demeanor during frequent addresses to the Ukrainian people.</p><p>He has also served as Ukraine&apos;s top representative to the rest of the world, pleading with NATO and countries such as the United States to come to its aid in order to stop Russia&apos;s aggression.</p><p>Other candidates named to the shortlist included the United States Supreme Court, Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo. ), and Tesla and Twitter CEO Elon Musk, who was named Person of the Year last year.</p><p>Since 1927, the magazine has named its Person of the Year, formerly known as Man of the Year or Woman of the Year, to the person who has had the greatest influence on the events of the year.</p><p>Russian President Vladimir Putin hoped to take Ukraine in three or four days, but his forces encountered stiffer-than-expected resistance from Ukrainian defenders galvanized by Zelensky&apos;s calls to fight to protect their country. The conflict has now lasted more than nine months.</p><p>Despite repeated Russian attacks on military and civilian targets, including the capital of Kyiv, Zelensky has remained in the country throughout the conflict. The Biden administration offered to get Zelensky out of the country in February, but he declined, instead requesting ammunition.</p><p>He has repeatedly emphasized to the world why continued support for Ukraine is necessary to prevent Russia from advancing, and he has called on the international community to hold Russia accountable for numerous documented alleged war crimes and human rights violations committed by Russian soldiers.</p></span><br /></div>

				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>Zelensky spoke with Time about his experiences leading the fight against Ukraine. He has been compared to former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who rallied the United Kingdom during WWII, but Zelensky has rejected the comparison, citing Churchill&apos;s reputation as an imperialist.</p><p>He preferred to be associated with author George Orwell, who wrote against authoritarianism, and comedian Charlie Chaplin, who used humor to criticize Adolf Hitler.</p><p>&quot;I&apos;ve used Charlie Chaplin as an example of how he used information as a weapon against fascism during WWII,&quot; he said. &quot;You see, there were these artists who aided society because they had a large following, and their influence was often greater than artillery.&quot;</p><p>Zelensky has been instrumental in dispelling Russian propaganda throughout the war, exposing false claims of genocide in Ukraine and Russian forces liberating the Ukrainian people.</p><p>He stated in the interview that Russia&apos;s invasion is just the latest attempt to seize control of Ukraine, but he wants to ensure that it is the last.</p><p>&quot;I have not completed this great, important action for our country,&quot; he explained. &quot;Not quite yet.&quot;</p><p>This page was last updated at 8:50 a.m.</p><p></span><br /></div>
