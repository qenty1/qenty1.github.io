It attributes this to his leadership of Ukraine&apos;s defense, which has slowed Russia&apos;s advance and allowed the country to reclaim key territories as well as its public image.</p><p>&quot;Whether one looks at this story of Ukraine with hope or fear, and the story is, of course, not fully written yet... Zelenskyy has really galvanized the world in a way we haven&apos;t seen in decades,&quot; Editor-in-Chief Edward Felsenthal said on the TODAY show.</p><p>The cover depicts Zelenskyy in his classic army-green sweater, surrounded by individual figures and protesters in crowds. They are interspersed with bright yellow sunflowers and Ukrainian flags in blue and yellow.</p><p>The publication cites Zelenskyy&apos;s adamant refusal to flee to another country when Russia first invaded in February, as well as his risky visits to frontline regions in the months since, as examples of his fortitude that have inspired other Ukrainians in their fight for freedom.</p><p>It also highlights his strategic efforts to keep Ukraine on the minds of supporters all over the world.</p><p>&quot;If we lose focus, we are in danger,&quot; his chief of staff, Andiry Yermak, said.</p></span><br /></div>

				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>Zelenskyy cuts a recognizable figure in his army-green tees and quarter-zips during his many virtual appearances at global conferences, speeches to educational institutions, and visits with foreign leaders and Hollywood celebrities alike.</p><p>Time (among many others) observes that the 44-year-old former actor and comedian, who was elected president in 2019 after playing one on a TV show, relies on a distinct background and set of skills to meet the current moment.</p><p>According to Time reporter Simon Shuster, &quot;[Zelenskyy] was adaptable, trained not to lose his nerve under pressure.&quot; &quot;He could read a crowd and respond to its moods and expectations. His new audience was the entire world. He was determined not to disappoint them.&quot;</p><p>However, the war has changed Zelenskyy in ways other than the physical toll it has exacted. According to one military adviser, Oleksiy Arestovych, the president has abandoned quick movements, jokes, and chattiness in favor of a more aggressive posture.</p><p>&quot;He&apos;s lost that actorly quality and turned into a boss,&quot; he explained.</p><p>Time magazine has named &quot;the spirit of Ukraine&quot; its person of the year, in addition to the president.</p><p>It recognizes some of the individuals who have contributed to Ukraine&apos;s resilience and recovery in a separate article, ranging from medical providers and humanitarian leaders to volunteers and journalists. While some of that assistance came from outside the country, the publication also recognizes Ukrainians.</p><p>&quot;If the choices their President articulated gave moral clarity to an era we&apos;d mostly been scrolling through, it was people who gave it meaning, by acting,&quot; it reads.</p><p></span><br /></div>
