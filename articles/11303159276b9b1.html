Balwani put nearly $5 million of his personal funds into Theranos and lost it all.</p></span><br /></div>

				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>&quot;Mr. Balwani is not the same as Elizabeth Holmes: he actually invested millions of dollars of his own money; he never sought fame or recognition; and he has a long history of quietly giving to those less fortunate (dating well before his time at Theranos) without seeking recognition or benefit,&quot; Balwani&apos;s attorneys wrote to the judge in a memo. &quot;All of these characteristics define Mr. Balwani as a person.&quot; In court, his attorneys echoed this sentiment.</p><p>Balwani was Theranos&apos; second-in-command and Holmes&apos; former romantic partner, though Holmes claims the older Balwani sexually and emotionally abused her during their relationship. Balwani, through his attorney, has denied the allegations.</p><p>During their tenure as CEOs, the two claimed that Theranos offered never-before-seen technology that could scan patients for hundreds of illnesses and other conditions with just a few drops of blood. Holmes, a Stanford dropout, claimed her company did something no other scientist had done before: it used a proprietary blood-testing device.</p><p>Prosecutors maintained that the tests were manipulated, and that the executives lied about the capabilities of both the tests and the device, bilking investors out of nearly $1 billion.</p><p>Davila testified in court that Balwani&apos;s financial statements &quot;weren&apos;t just projections, they were lies&quot; and a &quot;true flight from honest business practices.&quot;</p><p></span><br /></div>
