				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>Former Theranos CEO and President Ramesh &quot;Sunny&quot; Balwani was sentenced to nearly 13 years in prison for fraud on Wednesday, following the unraveling of the blood-testing juggernaut, which prompted criminal charges in California federal court against both Balwani and Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes, who was sentenced to more than 11 years in prison on Nov. 18.</p><p>Attorneys for Balwani attempted to blame Holmes during the sentencing hearing, telling U.S. District Court Judge Edward J. Davila that &quot;decisions were made by Elizabeth Holmes.&quot;</p><p>Davila had set a sentencing range of 11 years plus 3 months to 14 years, but prosecutors sought a 15-year sentence today because of his &quot;significant&quot; oversight role at Theranos&apos; lab business.</p><p>The ultimate guideline sentence was 155 months in prison plus three years probation. Davila set a surrender date of March 15, 2023.</p><p>Former romantic partners Balwani and Holmes led Theranos during its meteoric rise, attracting investors ranging from the DeVos family to news magnate Rupert Murdoch. The Wall Street Journal, one of Murdoch&apos;s publications, was the first to report on irregularities with Theranos&apos; ostensibly revolutionary blood-testing machines.</p><p>As COO, Balwani was in charge of both the laboratory and the company&apos;s finances. During his tenure, Theranos was plagued by repeated failures, including falsified documents and incorrect test results.</p><p>In a message to Holmes, Balwani stated, &quot;I am responsible for everything at Theranos.&quot; Balwani assumed overall responsibility for the company&apos;s day-to-day operations.</p></span><br /></div>

				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>Theranos claimed the machines could perform over 1,000 tests with just a few drops of blood. In reality, according to the Journal, the company could only process about a dozen tests. The Journal&apos;s reporting led to the company&apos;s dissolution in 2018 and, later, the arrests of Balwani and Holmes on fraud charges.</p><p>Balwani&apos;s sentencing in federal court concludes the Theranos saga, which captivated the public and inspired documentaries and novel treatments.</p><p>With a star-studded investor roster, a charismatic founder who drew comparisons to Apple&apos;s Steve Jobs, and a potentially game-changing technology, the company represented the pinnacle of Silicon Valley ingenuity for a time.</p><p>Theranos revelations resulted in a stunning fall from grace for both Balwani and Holmes, who had been in a relationship for much of their time at the company. In court, Holmes accused Balwani of abuse, citing text messages and contemporaneous notes from their relationship as evidence.</p><p>&quot;Kill the old Elizabeth,&quot; Balwani allegedly said.</p><p>Balwani engaged in a &quot;decade-long campaign of psychological abuse,&quot; according to Holmes&apos; lawyers. Balwani is nearly 20 years older than Holmes, who testified that he oversaw the lab and the business&apos;s finances.</p><p></span><br /></div>
