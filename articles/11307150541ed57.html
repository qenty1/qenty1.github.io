				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>Disgraced Theranos executive Ramesh &quot;Sunny&quot; Balwani was sentenced to 13 years in prison on Wednesday for his role in assisting founder and then-girlfriend Elizabeth Holmes in deceiving investors about the capabilities of the technology at the heart of their blood testing company.</p><p>According to NBC News, at the sentencing, U.S. District Court Judge Edward Davila stated that Balwani and Holmes &quot;misled investors and patients.&quot;</p><p>Prosecutors requested that Balwani serve 15 years in prison and pay more than $800 million in restitution.</p><p>Balwani&apos;s lawyers argued ahead of sentencing that Holmes was the one who ultimately made the decisions at Theranos that led to the company&apos;s demise, that Balwani sincerely believed the technology was legitimate and did not profit from any fraud, and that their client should be sentenced to probation or home confinement. In July, Balwani was found guilty on 12 counts of fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud.</p><p>Holmes was sentenced to more than 11 years in prison last month after being convicted on three counts of wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, all of which were related to defrauding investors.</p><p>Balwani was Theranos&apos; president and COO, and he secretly dated Holmes while they were running the company. Theranos claimed to have created a machine that could perform hundreds of blood tests with just one drop of blood, potentially disrupting the healthcare industry. Among the notable investors in the company were billionaires Rupert Murdoch and Larry Ellison, as well as former Secretary of State Colin Powell. George Schultz was a member of Theranos&apos; board of directors. Holmes was lauded as a rare young female founder in the tech industry, and she appeared on the covers of several magazines, including Forbes. Theranos&apos; narrative, however, began to unravel in 2015, when the Wall Street Journal reported that the technology&apos;s capacity did not live up to Holmes&apos; claims. Three years later, federal prosecutors charged Holmes and Balwani separately, alleging that the pair, who were secretly dating, knew they were lying about Theranos&apos; testing capabilities. They both entered not guilty pleas. Holmes claimed during her trial that Balwani abused her throughout their relationship, which he denied.</p></span><br /></div>

				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>During Holmes&apos; trial, text messages between her and Balwani revealed that the two were aware of Theranos&apos; problems and were becoming increasingly suspicious of fraud allegations and how to combat them by 2015, when the Wall Street Journal was investigating the company.</p><p>The story has been portrayed in the Hulu series The Dropout, with Amanda Seyfried playing Holmes and Naveen Andrews playing Balwani, since Theranos&apos; explosive fall from grace. The Inventor: Out For Blood In Silicon Valley was an HBO documentary that aired in 2019.</p><p>I am a native Texan who covers</p><p>$650 million is a lot of money, even in the bloated-budget world of aerospace. It&apos;s roughly the cost of six of Boeing&apos;s workhorse 737s or, for the more militarily inclined, seven F-35 stealth fighter jets. It&apos;s also how much NASA and Sierra Nevada Corp. spent developing the Dream Chaser, a reusable spacecraft designed to transport astronauts into orbit. Sierra Nevada, based in Sparks, Nevada, and 100% owned by Eren Ozmen and her husband, Fatih, contributed $300 million, with NASA contributing the remaining $350 million. The Dream Chaser took its first free flight in October 2013, when it was dropped from a helicopter at 12,500 feet. The landing gear failed, causing the vehicle to skid off the runway. NASA passed on Sierra Nevada&apos;s space plane a year later, instead awarding multibillion-dollar contracts to Boeing and SpaceX.</p><p></span><br /></div>
