				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>Rising retail theft may force companies such as Walmart to close stores or raise prices, according to Walmart CEO Doug McMillon, who appeared on CNBC&apos;s &quot;Squawk Box&quot; on Tuesday.</p><p>&quot;There is a problem with theft. It&apos;s higher than it has been in the past,&quot; he told the program.</p><p>Retail thefts have become more organized and brazen in recent years. According to Palo Alto Online, two men stole devices from an Apple store in Palo Alto, California, in late November, making off with $35,000 into a getaway car.</p><p>&quot;If that isn&apos;t corrected over time, prices will rise and/or stores will close,&quot; McMillon added on the show.</p><p>According to the National Retail Federation&apos;s 2022 Retail Security Survey, 32.8% of surveyed retailers believe organized retail crime has become a &quot;much greater&quot; priority and increased risk in the last five years.</p><p>&quot;Violence is an increasingly important concern among retailers,&quot; including theft and gun violence, according to the report.</p><p>Another growing concern is organized retail crime, which involves people acting as a network or team of some kind.</p><p>&quot;As detailed throughout this report, external theft and [organized retail crime] in particular is a significant and growing area of concern for retailers,&quot; according to the report. According to the survey, 52% of respondents said organized retail crime had increased, while none said it had decreased.</p><p>The NRF recommends that retailers form ORC teams to identify patterns and help keep stores from being targeted, but the vast majority (68.5%) do not.</p><p>McMillon stated that Walmart, which has over 4,000 locations in the United States, relies primarily on local law enforcement.</p><p>&quot;We have safety and security measures in place at each store location.&quot; &quot;I think having local law enforcement staffed and being a good partner is part of the equation, and that&apos;s usually how we approach it,&quot; he said on the show.</p></span><br /></div>

This type of organized retail crime has previously increased in difficult economic times, such as after the 2008 recession. Other studies, on the other hand, have failed to establish a consistent link between crime and various macroeconomic factors, such as the unemployment rate.</p><p>When pressed, McMillon stated that he desired &quot;consistency and clarity&quot; from policymakers regarding retail theft solutions.</p><p>Consumers are also feeling the pinch from historic inflation, which has slowed slightly in October.</p><p>Last month, the Wall Street Journal reported that Walmart (and competitors such as Target and Amazon) were putting pressure on suppliers to keep prices low.</p><p>Related: Walmart Has the Authority to Refuse High Supplier-Set Prices, But We Don&apos;t. Here Are Some Cost-Cutting Strategies for Small Businesses.</p><p>McMillon said on CNBC, &quot;We serve everyone.&quot; He added that they have &quot;budget-conscious consumers&quot; who &quot;have been under inflationary pressure for months.&quot;</p><p>At the same time, he affirmed Walmart is seeing an increase in customers who make over $100,000 a year suggesting everyone is trying to save money right now on purchases. (However, despite a looming recession, Americans are not putting much money into savings at the moment.)</p><p>To that end, he said inflation has stabilized or come down in some areas, including general merchandise, but has been &quot;stubborn&quot; in the area of dry goods and consumables.</p><p>Clothes and sports equipment are examples of general merchandise.</p><p>&quot;Prices have come down more aggressively in categories such as toys, sporting goods, apparel, and so on...</p><p></span><br /></div>
