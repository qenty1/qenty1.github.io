				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>This week, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon warned that rising thefts at the nation&apos;s largest retailer could force higher prices and even store closures.</p><p>&quot;Theft is a problem. &quot;It&apos;s higher than it&apos;s ever been,&quot; McMillon said during an appearance on CNBC&apos;s &quot;Squawk Box.&quot;&quot;</p><p>When asked Tuesday about how some jurisdictions have moved toward prosecuting theft only above a certain threshold, McMillon warned that approach could have long-term consequences for consumers.</p><p>&quot;If that is not corrected over time, prices will rise and/or stores will close,&quot; McMillon predicted.</p><p>&quot;It&apos;s a city by city, location by location thing. Store managers collaborate with local law enforcement, and we have good relationships there for the most part, so that&apos;s how we approach it &quot;He continued.</p><p>Walmart isn&apos;t the only retailer dealing with an increase in shoplifting and large-scale, organized thefts.</p><p>Walmart competitor Target said last month that theft was a growing problem in its stores as well, with the number of thefts increasing by 50% this year.</p><p>According to Business Insider, while discussing third-quarter earnings results, executives for the Minneapolis-based retailer said organized retail crime has been a major driving force behind hundreds of millions of dollars in profit losses due to inventory shrink in 2022.</p><p>According to a 2022 National Retail Federation survey, retailers reported an average 26.5% increase in organized retail crime.

The swap, which occurred during a period of heightened tensions over Ukraine, accomplished a top goal for President Joe Biden, but it came at a high cost, leaving an American imprisoned in Russia for nearly four years.</p><p>The agreement, the second in eight months with Russia, resulted in the release of the most prominent American detained abroad. Griner is a two-time Olympic gold medalist whose months-long detention on drug charges drew unprecedented attention to the population of unjustly detained people.</p><p>On Thursday morning, Biden confirmed the news by tweeting that Griner was on her way home. Griner&apos;s wife, Charelle Griner, is shown in the tweet smiling and embracing the president in the Oval Office.</p><p>Biden is scheduled to speak about the prisoner swap from the White House at 8:30 a.m. Eastern. It&apos;s unclear whether Charelle Griner will speak when the president speaks.</p><p>Biden&apos;s approval to release a Russian felon dubbed &quot;the Merchant of Death&quot; highlighted the mounting pressure on his administration to bring Griner home, especially after the recent resolution of her criminal case and subsequent transfer to a penal colony.</p><p>The swap was confirmed by US officials with direct knowledge of the negotiations who were not authorized to discuss the agreement publicly before a White House announcement and spoke on the condition of anonymity.</p><p>After months of tense negotiations, Russian and US officials have expressed cautious optimism in recent weeks, with Biden saying in November that he was hopeful that Russia would engage in a deal now that the midterm elections were over. A top Russian official said last week that a deal could be reached before the end of the year.</p><p>Even so, the fact that the agreement was a one-for-one swap came as a surprise given that the U.S. </span><br /></div>
