				<img class="main-image" src="https://i0.wp.com/searchfeedly.xyz/images/221208/15/11379.jpg" alt="Elon Musk has found a new Tesla CEO who is sleeping in Gigafactories. What is his name <br/><br/>? Tesla CEO Elon Musk appears to be preparing to leave the electric vehicle manufacturer and be replaced by a new face. According to the Chinese publication PingWest, Musk has decided to promote Tesla China President Tom Zhu Xiaotong to the position of global CEO of the EV manufacturer. It also claimed that the information came from people who were familiar with the situation. This news comes just a few weeks after Musk purchased the microblogging social media website Twitter. Several Tesla investors have accused him in recent months of not paying enough attention to the automaker and instead focusing on Twitter."></img>

				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>Since joining the company in 2014, Zhu has been instrumental in guiding the EV brand to numerous successes in China. Tesla&apos;s sales increase in China is frequently attributed to Zhu&apos;s strategy. He also assisted the automaker in the construction of Giga Shanghai, one of the company&apos;s most important factories and its primary global export hub. Zhu began his Tesla career as the director of the automaker&apos;s Supercharger program in China. However, he was quickly promoted to Global Vice President and President of China for the automaker.</p><p>According to the report, Musk has already informed the Tesla board of a potential successor for the CEO position. Interestingly, he has stated numerous times that he never wanted to be Tesla&apos;s CEO, but there was no one else available. He also reportedly stated that the jobs he performs at Tesla are not CEO positions. Instead, he has always referred to himself as a company engineer.</p><p>While the news of Tesla&apos;s new CEO has already captured the attention of the world, it is unclear when Elon Musk will step down as CEO of the electric car company. Furthermore, it is unclear what plans he has and when he intends to carry them out.</p><p>According to people familiar with the situation, Elon Musk&apos;s bankers are considering providing the billionaire with new margin loans backed by Tesla Inc. stock to replace some of the high-interest debt he piled on Twitter Inc.</p><p>The margin loans are one of several options discussed by the Morgan Stanley-led bank group and Musk&apos;s advisers to alleviate the burden of the $13 billion in debt Twitter incurred as part of Musk&apos;s $44 billion acquisition, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private.</p></span><br /></div>

				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>After a deterioration in credit markets and a tumultuous start to Musk&apos;s reign at Twitter made the debt difficult to syndicate to institutional investors, banks were forced to fund the entire debt package with their own cash. If the current debt structure is maintained, the company will face annual interest costs of about $1.2 billion, which is more than a year&apos;s worth of Twitter earnings.</p><p>According to the people, the discussions have so far focused on how to replace $3 billion of unsecured debt on which Twitter pays an interest rate of 11.75%, the maximum banks guaranteed Musk when they agreed to finance the acquisition in April.</p><p>The talks are preliminary, and no decisions have been made, according to the sources.</p><p>Musk&apos;s representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Twitter and Tesla did not respond to requests for comment because they no longer have communications departments.</p><p></span><br /></div>
