				</div>
				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>An Amazon delivery driver said last year that the high volume of orders during the holiday season &quot;makes life hell.&quot; This year, if a customer says, &quot;Alexa, thank my driver,&quot; these contracted workers will receive a $5 tip.</p><p>Meanwhile, the DC Attorney General announced today that Amazon is being sued for allegedly misleading customers by using tips to cover couriers&apos; base pay.</p><p>The new thank you feature is part of a promotion Amazon is running to commemorate its impending 15 billion package delivery milestone. If a driver is one of the first million to receive a thank you note, they will receive $5. The top five drivers who receive the most thank yous will each receive a $10,000 bonus, as well as $10,000 donated to a charity of their choice.</p><p>This means that Amazon will pay approximately $5.1 million to employees as a result of this promotion. Amazon, for example, spent more than $4.3 million on anti-union consultants last year.</p><p>&quot;For drivers, it&apos;s more than just the packages they deliver; they form relationships with customers, support the community in difficult times, and sometimes play the role of the unexpected hero,&quot; Beryl Tomay, Amazon&apos;s vice president of Last Mile Delivery, wrote in a press release.</p><p>According to the Amazon Flex website, these &quot;unexpected heroes&quot; can expect to earn between $18 and $25 per hour. Drivers hired through Amazon Flex are independent contractors who use their own vehicles to make deliveries on their own schedule. Amazon also hires drivers through Delivery Service Partners (DSP), which are independent companies.</p></span><br /></div>

				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>According to a VICE report from last year, the holiday season frequently causes delivery drivers to work late into the night, increasing the risk of the job. Some drivers have reported having guns drawn on them while making a delivery late at night, while others have driven with their seatbelts buckled behind them to speed up deliveries. Drivers are still peeing in bottles, despite Amazon&apos;s vehement denial that this is a widespread practice. Then, in October, a driver was killed by dogs while on the job. Amazon responded with a memo reminding drivers to look for a paw print icon in the app&apos;s &quot;delivery notes&quot; section so they &quot;aren&apos;t surprised by our four-legged customers.&quot;</p><p>According to posts on a Reddit community of Amazon drivers, these late-night deliveries are still the norm.</p><p>&quot;Unfortunately, there are a lot of places I just pull up to and they&apos;re straight out sketched out wondering if they&apos;re going to be robbed,&quot; one Reddit user wrote yesterday. &quot;I always wear flashers and have some of my vest showing, but that&apos;s the best I can do in these cringey situations to identify myself.&quot; The user stated that they requested an Amazon-branded jacket from their DSP in order to make it more obvious that they work for Amazon, but they were told that they needed a month under their belt.</p><p>Amazon has recently made investments to increase benefits and pay for warehouse workers and delivery drivers by about $1 per hour, but these investments fall short of some labor organizers&apos; demands for a $5 per hour raise. Amazon will invest nearly $1 billion in this endeavor over the next year. These investments come during a time when reports say Amazon could literally run out of U.S. warehouse workers to hire by 2024, since turnover in these roles is so high.</p><p></span><br /></div>
