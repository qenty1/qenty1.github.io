According to the final results released by the Election Commission of India, the Congress, which had a 68-seat majority, won 40 of them (ECI).</p><p>The winning party with a clear majority in the elections is the party that wins 35 seats. The BJP won 44 seats in the 2017 assembly elections, while the Congress won 21, with one seat going to the CPI(M) and two going to independent candidates. According to the final results updated by the Election Commission of India, the Congress won the Himachal Pradesh assembly election with 40 seats (ECI). The BJP received 25 seats, while the AAP received only five.</p><p>In terms of vote share in Himachal, the Congress is only marginally ahead of the BJP, with 43.90% of the vote to the BJP&apos;s 42.99%. Others have received 10.4 percent of the vote in the hill state.</p><p>The BJP attempted to nip anti-incumbency in the bud in Himachal Pradesh by removing 11 of its 44 MLAs. However, this backfired and resulted in a full-fledged rebellion. Many of the rebels could not be appeased, and it is believed that this cost the party tens of seats, a crucial difference that could have cost it power.</p><p>There&apos;s also a family feud: Dhani Ram Shandil of the Congress defeats his son-in-law to retain Solan seat</p><p>Veteran Congress leader Dhani Ram Shandil of the Congress defeated his nearest BJP rival and son-in-law Rajesh Kashyap to retain the Solan seat in Himachal Pradesh. Dhani Ram Shandil, a retired army colonel and the oldest candidate in the race at 82, led Rajesh Kashyap from the start, and the final margin of victory was 3,858 votes.</p></span><br /></div>
