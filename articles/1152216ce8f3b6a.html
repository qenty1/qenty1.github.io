				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, have attacked &quot;unconscious bias&quot; within the royal family and defended their decision to leave the institution, as their highly anticipated Netflix documentary series threatens to deepen the couple&apos;s rift with Buckingham Palace.</p><p>After months of speculation, the first three episodes of the project, titled &quot;Harry  Meghan,&quot; were released on Thursday.</p><p>They discuss the couple&apos;s first romance and Meghan&apos;s first exposure to the structures and demands of royal life, as well as Harry&apos;s childhood, the pervasiveness of Britain&apos;s tabloid media, and his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales&apos;, death.</p><p>Harry also accuses the royal family of having &quot;unconscious bias&quot; that blinded them to the difficulties he and Meghan faced in the years and months leading up to their dramatic departure.</p><p>After years of tension between Harry and his father, King Charles, and brother, Prince William, Buckingham and Kensington Palaces are likely to be braced for the fallout from the series.</p><p>&quot;It&apos;s difficult to look back now and wonder, what on earth happened?&quot; &quot;Like, how did we end up here?,&quot; Harry said in the first episode&apos;s video diary, which was recorded shortly after the couple completed their final royal duties in March 2020.</p><p>He stated that he became &quot;genuinely concerned for the safety of my family,&quot; criticizing the media&apos;s intrusion, which he has frequently lamented in recent years. Within the first few minutes of the show,</p><p>Harry took aim at the media. &quot;No one knows the entire truth. &quot;We know the whole truth, the institution knows the whole truth, and the media knows the whole truth because they were in on it,&quot; Harry explained. He believes it is his &quot;duty&quot; to &quot;uncover this exploitation and bribery that occurs within our media.&quot;</p></span><br /></div>

				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>The series follows the couple&apos;s explosive interview with Oprah Winfrey, which contained a flurry of criticisms of members of the royal family and caused uproar at the palace.</p><p>It is the monarchy&apos;s first major public relations test under King Charles III, who has been openly criticized by Harry since their divorce and whose relationship with his son has deteriorated.</p><p>Buckingham Palace said on Thursday that it will not comment on the Duke and Duchess of Sussex&apos;s new Netflix docu-series, which premiered on Thursday.</p><p>According to a royal source, neither Buckingham Palace nor Kensington Palace, nor any members of the royal family, were approached for comment on the series&apos; content. Members of the British royal family &quot;refused to comment on the content,&quot; according to the Netflix documentary.</p><p>&quot;I accept that there will be people around the world who fundamentally disagree with what I&apos;ve done and how I&apos;ve done it,&quot; Prince Harry said of the watershed decision to leave the royal family in early 2020, which set the stage for years of revelations from the couple and turned their relationships with Harry&apos;s relatives frosty.</p><p>&quot;However, I knew I had to do everything I could to protect my family, especially after what had happened to my mother,&quot; Harry continued.</p><p>The couple has previously spoken about the constraints placed on them as members of the royal family, and that frustration was evident throughout the documentary.</p><p>In 2017, Meghan described her engagement announcement as a &quot;orchestrated reality show.&quot; </span><br /></div>
