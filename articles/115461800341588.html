				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>Much sensory overload? A multi-layered full moon is on its way to us, adorning the night sky on December 7 at 11:08 p.m. ET via 16 degrees of curious Gemini. This lunar phase heightens and intensifies our emotional waves in addition to representing a full-circle moment. Although, given the fact that this lunation forms an exact conjunction with Mars retrograde, the term &quot;emotionally charged&quot; barely scratches the surface. Put on your loincloth! Hot-headed Because Mars is the planet of action, energy, and passion, irritability is unavoidable when it is retrograde. Imagine being the God of War and Aggression and being forced to slow down. Mars isn&apos;t having it, and its proximity to the moon can be extremely volatile and provoking.</p><p>Mercury rules this mutable air sign, which represents everything from our communication style to how we process information. Gemini is the third sign of the zodiac, and its archetype represents our cognitive functioning and immediate environment when it comes to our human development. With the emotional intensity of the full moon, Mars retrograde&apos;s repressed rage, and Gemini&apos;s chattiness, it&apos;s safe to expect verbal confrontation and a lot of overthinking! Although, with Mercury, the full moon&apos;s ruler, transiting through structured Capricorn, this emotional climax has a serious undertone. Saturnian themes such as traditions, hierarchies, corporations, and careers are also likely to come up in conversations with authority figures.</p><p>We must not overlook the sun in Sagittarius, especially since it is directly opposite the moon at this time. For example, Sagittarius&apos; archetype is a representation of our experiences and how these moments influenced our belief systems to this day, in addition to the push and pull effects between your emotional and physical reality that occur during the full moon phase. Having said that, regardless of the structure of our previous experiences, this culmination is urging us to retrace our steps and reconsider our path of choice. And, while it&apos;s no secret that our experiences shape our perception of reality, the information presented to us may abruptly change our sense of direction. This is analogous to losing signal on your smartphone maps while driving through the middle of nowhere.</p></span><br /></div>

				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>The upcoming full moon will rock your world if your sun sign, moon sign, or rising sign falls under any of the following zodiac signs. This is why:</p><p>Your mindset and communication style are drastically changing, but it&apos;s all part of a divine plan. Granted, having your celestial ruler, Mars, in retrograde motion isn&apos;t easy, but you&apos;re being asked to slow down in order to observe the dynamic of your exchanges, particularly when it comes to your sense of authority. The red planet will also play an important role at this time, conjuncting the full moon in your third house of immediate surroundings and default thought processes. At this time, important facts may be brought to your attention that may or may not contradict the foundation of your worldview.</p><p></span><br /></div>
