The BJP steamrolled the Opposition, which included the newcomer Aam Aadmi Party, riding on the charisma of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who addressed 31 election rallies in his home state and continued to hold sway over voters. The BJP outperformed its previous high of 127 seats in 2002, when Mr. Modi was Chief Minister.</p><p>Today, the votes for Gujarat&apos;s 182 Assembly seats were counted. The elections were held in two phases, with 89 seats voting on December 1, and 92 Assembly segments voting on December 5. Gujarat recorded a voter turnout of 64.33% in the recently concluded elections, a drop of more than 4% from the previous Assembly elections in 2017.</p><p>The BJP won its first Assembly seat in Gujarat, where its candidate Ritesh Vasava defeated heavyweight tribal leader and seven-time MLA Chhotubhai Vasava by 23,500 votes. Ritesh Vasava received 89,933 votes, with Chhotubhai Vasava receiving 66,433 votes.</p><p>Mr. Chhotubhai Vasava, 78, was defeated by his one-time aide Mr. Ritesh Vasava in the Scheduled Tribes-reserved constituency of Bharuch district. This was the BJP&apos;s first victory in this Assembly seat.</p><p>The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Congress finished third and fourth, with 19,722 and 15,219 votes, respectively.</p><p>According to EC figures, the Congress represented the tribal-dominated seat in the Assembly in 1962, 1967, 1972, 1975, 1980, and 1985. Chhotubhai Vasava had won the seat seven times in a row, first as a Janata Dal (United) candidate, then as an independent, and finally as the nominee of his own Bharatiya Tribal Party (BTP). I</p><p>BJP candidate Yogesh Patel defeated the Congress in Gujarat&apos;s Anand Assembly constituency by a comfortable margin of 41,623 votes.</p></span><br /></div>

The Congress and the BJP were neck and neck in the early rounds of counting, but the saffron party emerged victorious with a comfortable vote margin.</p><p>After a 25-year absence, the Opposition Congress won the seat in 2017. After three failed attempts, Mr. Parmar won the Assembly segment by a little more than 5,000 votes five years ago.</p><p>According to senior Congress leader Bharatsinh Solanki, the party will analyze the reasons for its defeat and take corrective action. Kirtikumar Patel of the PTI and* Bharatiya Janata Party defeated Arvind Patel by over 51,000 votes in Gujarat&apos;s Unjha Assembly segment. Mr. Patel received 88,066 votes, while the Congress candidate received 36,845 votes. Urvish Patel of the Aam Aadmi Party received 18,060 votes.</p><p>Unjha, known as Asia&apos;s spice capital, was a prestige seat for the BJP because it included Prime Minister Narendra Modi&apos;s hometown of Vadnagar.</p><p>The Congress won this seat in the 2017 elections after 45 years, thanks to the Patidar agitation.</p><p>The BJP fielded Kiritkumar Patel, a Patidar and an RSS functionary close to Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat, against Congress candidate and local businessman Arvind Patel, while the AAP made the race triangular by nominating 31-year-old Mr. Urvish Patel, who recently returned from New Zealand and entered politics.</p><p></span><br /></div>
