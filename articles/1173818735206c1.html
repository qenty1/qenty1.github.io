				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>Lasik eye surgery is a popular vision-correction procedure that many Americans believe is safe and effective, but the US Food and Drug Administration has now issued guidance warning of potential complications.</p><p>While many patients are pleased with the results of their surgery, the recommended new guidance states that complications can include dry eyes, double vision, difficulty driving at night, and, in rare cases, chronic eye pain. Some patients will require eyeglasses even after surgery.</p><p>According to the New York Times, the draft also mentions that certain types of patients, such as those with chronic conditions like diabetes and those who take certain medications, may be at a higher risk of problems.</p><p>More than 600 people and professional organizations have commented on the recommendations since they were first released this summer.</p><p>&quot;All we&apos;re asking for is balance,&quot; incoming vice president of the American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery Dr. Vance Thompson told the Times. &quot;This document focuses on the risks and complications of Lasik, with no mention of the benefits, and the tone is negative enough to scare patients.&quot;</p><p>Thompson stated that in the FDA&apos;s studies, more than 90% of patients were satisfied because they were &quot;achieving good vision without spectacles, which is the goal of most patients.&quot; Surgeons and device manufacturers have asked for the draft recommendations to be withdrawn.</p><p>However, a professional organization representing optometrists suggested adding even more safeguards to the draft, including pregnant women and those with irregular astigmatism, according to the Times.</p><p>&quot;I&apos;ve been waiting 14 years for this to happen,&quot; Paula Cofer, a Florida woman who testified before the FDA in 2008 and again in 2018 that Lasik surgery ruined her eyesight and left her in chronic pain, told the Times.</p></span><br /></div>

They now realize it&apos;s the FDA saying this &quot;Cofer continued.</p><p>Lasik is typically a 15-minute procedure in which the surgeon reshapes the cornea with cuts and a laser to correct poor vision. According to the Times, the procedure is frequently not covered by insurance and can cost patients thousands of dollars out of pocket.</p><p>Despite this, over 500,000 adults have the surgery each year, and many ophthalmologists believe it is safe, with complications occurring only infrequently.</p><p>The FDA collaborated on and analyzed studies on Lasik outcomes published in the previous decade to develop the draft recommendations.</p><p>One of these studies discovered that three months after Lasik, nearly half of patients who had previously had no visual symptoms did so. This included noticing halo effects around lights. Dry eyes affected about one-third of the patients.</p><p>&quot;Before undergoing this elective procedure, patients undergoing Lasik surgery should be adequately counseled about the possibility of developing new visual symptoms after surgery,&quot; the study authors wrote. The FDA has not stated when the guidance will be published. According to the newspaper, the agency did respond to the Times with a statement dismissing some criticism and noting that it routinely issues labeling guidance for medical devices.</p><p></span><br /></div>
