				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>Although femtosecond laser technology has greatly improved LASIK, femtosecond laser-related complications do exist and can occur in some cases, according to a surgeon speaking here.</p><p>Fortunately, according to J. Vicente Rodriguez, MD, at the Alicante Refractiva International meeting, none of the potential intra- or postoperative complications would jeopardize surgical success if managed properly.</p><p>Dr. Rodriguez stated that he uses an IntraLase femtosecond laser (Advanced Medical Optics) and thus is concerned about potential complications with this device. Suction loss, in particular, may occur during surgery when creating the raster pattern, he said.</p><p>&quot;You can resume treatment with the same cone and a new ring. [However], if suction loss occurs while on the visual axis, it is preferable to wait about a month and then go about 40 m deeper &quot;He stated. &quot;Repeat the side cut only, reducing the flap diameter with a new, smaller ring if suction loss occurs during the side cut.&quot;</p><p>Another common complication is vertical gas breakthrough, which can occur when creating thin flaps of 100 m or less, or if there is a focal break or scar in the Bowman&apos;s layer, he said.</p><p>&quot;If this happens, never try to lift the flap because you will most likely end up with a buttonhole,&quot; Dr. Rodriguez advised.</p><p>A horizontal gas breakthrough, on the other hand, may occur when the gas is vented in short bursts.</p><p>The opaque bubble layer (OBL), which is a collection of gas bubbles in the intralamellar space above and below the resection plane, is another potential complication. According to him, early OBL spreads ahead of the raster pattern, whereas late OBL appears as opaque patches in areas of the raster pattern.</p><p>&quot;OBL is an excess of gas and water that can occur for a variety of reasons. It is more common in brown eyes and can happen when energy levels are too high or the pocket is too close to the limbus, not deep enough, or too narrow &quot;Dr. Rodriguez explained.</p></span><br /></div>

				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>OBL occurs in approximately 20% of patients and disappears after 15 to 45 minutes. It has no effect on surgical outcomes, he says, but it may cause issues with using the eye tracker and lifting the flap.</p><p>Gas bubbles can occasionally diffuse into the anterior chamber via Schlemm&apos;s canal.</p><p>According to Dr. Rodriguez, such a complication is not severe, but it can disrupt the excimer laser tracking system and may take several hours to dissipate.</p><p>According to him, postoperative complications such as diffuse lamellar keratitis (DLK) and transient light sensitivity syndrome (TLSS) were more common with previous generations of IntraLase and are rarely reported with the latest 60 kHz model.</p><p>&quot;In femto-LASIK, [DLK] may be related to energy levels because the most recent generation of IntraLase is associated with only a small number of these cases,&quot; Dr. Rodriguez speculated.</p><p>TLSS is a rare complication of femto-LASIK that typically appears 2 to 6 weeks after surgery. Keratocyte activation or gas migration to the corneal periphery or episclera could be the cause.</p><p>Patients may exhibit moderate to severe light sensitivity while maintaining good visual acuity. TLSS resolves spontaneously between 1 and 3 months postoperatively and can be treated with corticosteroids, according to Dr. Rodriguez.</p><p>&quot;Again, the latest generation of IntraLase appears to have overcome this problem,&quot; he said.</p><p></span><br /></div>
