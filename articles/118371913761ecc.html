(Screenshot/CSPAN)</p><p>Republicans, according to the senator, are not interested in assisting companies that &quot;silence conservatives and center-right voters.&quot;</p><p>Cotton turned to McMullen and said, &quot;You know, this situation reminds me a little bit of where Big Tech companies have been in recent years. They&apos;ve come to Washington because they&apos;re worried about regulation from our Democratic allies or action from the Biden administration, and they&apos;re expecting Republicans, who have traditionally been more supportive of free enterprise, to defend them.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&apos;ve warned them for years that if they silence conservatives and center-right voters in their company, they shouldn&apos;t come to Republican senators and ask them to carry the water for them whenever our Democratic friends want to regulate them or block their mergers,&quot; he continued.</p><p>Conveying his disinterest in assisting McMullen, the senator concluded, &quot;I&apos;ll just say it: I&apos;m sorry this is happening to you. Best wishes.&quot;</p></span><br /></div>

Tom Cotton of Arkansas speaks with an activist on Aug. 16, 2022, at a New Hampshire GOP fundraiser in Rye, N.H. (Source: Fox News)</p><p>Conservatives on Twitter praised Cotton&apos;s rebuke of the ostensibly progressive grocery chain. Christopher Bedford, a Conservative commentator, tweeted, &quot;That&apos;s exactly right. Kroger&apos;s CEO forces his shelf-stockers and checkout employees to go through left-wing indoctrination in order to work for him, then pays himself nearly 400 times their salaries. Send him to his Democrat friends for scraps when he comes begging for more money and power.&quot; Briscoe Cain, a conservative lawyer, responded with the now-popular adage, &quot;Woke up. Broke, go.&quot;</p><p>Author and former Pentagon official Amber Smith, as well as The Spectator contributing editor Stephen L. Miller, both tweeted, &quot;This is the way.&quot;</p><p>Claremont Institute Lincoln Fellow Inez Stepman tweeted, &quot;This is my politics.&quot;</p><p>Conservative digital strategist Logan Hall praised Cotton&apos;s tone, saying, &quot;More of this, please.&quot;</p><p>The Kroger supermarket chain is planning a merger with the Albertsons supermarket chain.
