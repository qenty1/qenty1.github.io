				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton has been praised for mocking Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen&apos;s efforts to secure Republican support for his grocery merger plans.</p><p>Conservatives applaud Senator Cotton&apos;s response to Rodney McMullen&apos;s efforts to rally Republican support for his grocery merger plans.</p><p>Politicians examined the competitive impact of the proposed Kroger-Albertsons merger at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on November 29, 2022. The $25 billion deal would propel the companies to the dominance of Amazon and Walmart, raising concerns about inflated prices and the exclusion of small businesses.</p><p>Republican Senator Cotton chastised the businessman for seeking GOP assistance in opposing the Democratic Party&apos;s plans to block his company&apos;s merger and regulate it in the aftermath of the religious discrimination lawsuit in October.</p><p>Kroger was sued for $180,000 after two Arkansas employees were fired in 2019 for refusing to wear aprons with a rainbow heart embroidered on them.</p><p>According to the lawsuit, the workers believed the logo supported the LGBTQ community, which contradicted their &quot;religious belief that homosexuality is a sin.&quot;</p><p>Although Kroger denied that the rainbow symbol indicated support for LGBTQ rights, the company has agreed to develop a religious accommodation policy. As part of the settlement, the supermarket chain will also provide more intensive religious discrimination training for managers, according to the Washington Post.</p><p>&quot;Thank you Senator Cotton for addressing the elephant in the room,&quot; a supporter tweeted. &quot;I worked for a major wireless company that relied on Republicans for a massive merger, only to become one of America&apos;s most woke companies.&quot;</p></span><br /></div>

				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>A second person called out: &quot;It&apos;s encouraging to see our Republicans finally removing the white gloves and putting on the boxing gloves. It&apos;s long overdue.&quot;</p><p>Watch the full interview between McMullen and Cotton here.</p><p>On October 14, Kroger announced the proposed plans, citing a desire to &quot;unite around their purpose to feed the human spirit; deliver quality, value, convenience, and choice for customers; and increase associate wages and benefits.&quot;</p><p>The combined company would own nearly 5,000 stores in the United States, rivaling Walmart&apos;s 5,320. Albertsons and Kroger currently employ over 700,000 people across their portfolios, but senators are concerned that their joint venture will result in layoffs and price increases.</p><p>Democrats Jerry Nadler of New York, Pramila Jayapal of Washington, David Cicilline of Rhode Island, and Adam Smith of Washington all emphasized the negative effects of Kroger-Albertsons&apos; control of roughly 13% of the US grocery market. &quot;This acquisition threatens to create competition-stifling concentration in markets across the country, harming consumers, workers, and small businesses,&quot; they wrote to FTC Chair Lisa Khan.</p><p>&quot;Corporate consolidation in the grocery retail industry results in higher prices and less consumer choice,&quot; they added. Meanwhile, complete market dominance equals less competition, so the acquisition may jeopardize stable wages and safe working conditions.</p><p></span><br /></div>
