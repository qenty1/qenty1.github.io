				</div>
				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>Members of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Competition Policy, Antitrust, and Consumer Rights grilled the enlightened CEOs of grocery behemoths Kroger and Albertsons last week about their proposed $25 billion merger.</p><p>Fearing that the merger will &quot;raise prices, cut jobs, and exacerbate inequality in food access through the closure of more locations,&quot; unions and progressive advocacy groups have lobbied the Biden administration to halt the merger, according to The Hill.</p><p>Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton, a Republican, delivered one of the best legislative smackdowns I&apos;ve seen in a long time during his questioning of Kroger CEO William Rodney McMullen.</p><p>He inquired about McMullen&apos;s recent $180,000 settlement with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in a religious discrimination case. Kroger fired two Christian employees from its Conway, Arkansas, location for refusing to wear aprons with rainbow pride hearts on them.</p><p>McMullen stated that he was unaware of the situation. Cotton expressed surprise that the CEO was unaware of a legal action brought by the US government against his company.</p><p>The uneasy CEO defended the hearts by stating that &quot;Kroger&apos;s primary goal is to nourish the human spirit. And the heart is an important part of feeding the human spirit. And that heart is our fundamental strategy for achieving our goal. The colors were unrelated to anything.&quot;</p><p>The senator was not convinced. &quot;Well, I&apos;m not sure I believe that because it was introduced as a supposed sign of inclusivity during Pride month. A federal judge disagreed with it as well. That&apos;s why he denied your company&apos;s summary judgment motion, and you just paid $180,000 to two employees you wrongfully terminated.&quot;</p><p>He asked McMullen if he wanted to apologize to those employees &quot;for the ordeal they endured?&quot;</p></span><br /></div>

				<br />			
				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>The CEO declined, stating that he needed to learn more about the case.</p><p>Cotton also cited Kroger&apos;s &quot;Allyship Guide,&quot; which advised employees to stop using the terms &quot;sir&quot; and &quot;ma&apos;am&quot; because they are not inclusive.</p><p>&quot;Okay. This situation reminds me a little bit of the predicament that Big Tech companies have been in in recent years. They&apos;ve come to Washington because they&apos;re worried about regulation from our Democratic allies or action from the Biden administration. And they expect Republicans, who have traditionally been more pro-free enterprise, to defend them. And I&apos;ve been warning them for years that if they silence conservatives and center-right voters across the country, if they discriminate against them in their business, they shouldn&apos;t come to Republican senators and ask them to carry the water for them whenever our Democratic friends want to regulate them or block their mergers.&quot;</p><p>Then there was the zinger: &quot;So, I&apos;ve heard a lot of questions about it today, and I&apos;ve read a lot about it in the news, and I&apos;ll just say this: I&apos;m sorry this is happening to you. Best wishes.&quot;</p><p>The entire conversation between Cotton and McMullen can be found below.</p><p>Sen. Cotton just set an example for how Republican lawmakers should treat business leaders whose adherence to woke principles has rendered them deaf to common decency.</p><p></span><br /></div>
