				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>Nearly 50 African heads of state are expected in Washington, D.C. next week for the US-Africa Leaders Summit. Food security, global health, and education will all be topics of discussion. While not on the formal agenda, the summit is about the United States and African countries. The United States&apos; rivalry with China, and how it affects Africa, will undoubtedly be discussed and analyzed in private conversations surrounding the summit.</p><p>The Biden administration&apos;s U.S. Africa strategy, published in August, correctly states that &quot;Sub-Saharan Africa&apos;s governments, institutions, and people will play a critical role in addressing global challenges.&quot; The strategy assesses China&apos;s growing engagement with Africa as &quot;an important arena to challenge the rules-based international order, advance its own narrow commercial and geopolitical interests, undermine transparency and openness, and weaken U.S. relations with African peoples and governments.&quot; This, I believe, is correct. To effectively advance US interests, Africa policy must be founded on a realistic assessment of Chinese activity on the continent, one that recognizes the African perspective.</p><p>Since 2000, China has hosted the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation every three years, which is widely regarded as an important means of advancing Chinese diplomatic and commercial interests. Other countries that hold Africa summits include Russia, Turkey, and Japan. The United States is only holding its second Africa summit, the first being in 2014. While summits have been chastised for failing to produce tangible results, there is reason to believe that this summit will have an impact. For example, its Business Forum&apos;s &quot;deal rooms&quot; will announce commercial transactions involving US and African companies, some of which will be supported by US government agencies. The summit is an important symbol of the importance that the United States places on its African relationships. African leaders have responded positively, with nearly every invited leader planning to attend.</p></span><br /></div>

				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>China&apos;s involvement in Africa began with its support for liberation movements opposing colonial rule. Beginning in the late 1990s, China&apos;s commercial engagement increased, culminating in 2013 with the Belt and Road Initiative, a well-funded effort to increase political influence and commercial relationships throughout the developing world. Lending for infrastructure development engineered and built by Chinese companies, as well as resource extraction by Chinese mining and energy firms, are key activities. While certain countries, such as Ethiopia, Angola, and Zambia, have received special attention, China has expanded its presence in almost every African country. Since the Cold War, China&apos;s influence in Africa has grown significantly, while the United States&apos; influence has declined.</p><p>China is Africa&apos;s largest two-way trading partner, with a projected $254 billion in trade in 2021, outpacing US-Africa trade by a factor of four. China is the largest source of foreign direct investment in Africa, supporting hundreds of thousands of jobs. This is roughly double the level of foreign direct investment in the United States. While Chinese lending to African countries has recently declined, China remains the continent&apos;s largest lender. With China&apos;s dramatic rise to become the world&apos;s second largest economy, it is to be expected that its commercial activity in Africa will increase, especially given China&apos;s need for raw materials to support its very large manufacturing base.</p><p></span><br /></div>
