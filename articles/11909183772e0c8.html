The premises were adorned with Chinese and Saudi Arabian flags, and members of the Saudi Royal Guard lined up with swords and played music.</p><p>In contrast to US President Joe Biden&apos;s visit to Saudi Arabia earlier this year, the two leaders smiled warmly and posed for photos.</p><p>Shortly after, China and Saudi Arabia signed a comprehensive strategic partnership agreement that includes a number of agreements and memorandums of understanding, including on hydrogen energy, coordination between the kingdom&apos;s Vision 2030 and China&apos;s Belt and Road Initiative, and direct investment, according to the official Saudi Press Agency (SPA), without providing further details.</p><p>On Wednesday, Xi arrived in Riyadh, where he was met by Saudi Prince Faisal bin Bandar bin Abdulaziz, Governor of Riyadh Region, and Saudi Prince Faisal bin Farhan bin Abdullah, Minister of Foreign Affairs. Saudi military jets escorted the Chinese president&apos;s plane, a purple carpet was rolled out, and canons were fired upon his arrival.</p><p>The reception for US President Joe Biden was widely perceived to be less glamorous. In July, the American president was welcomed by the governor of Mecca and the Saudi ambassador to the United States in the Red Sea port city of Jeddah. Biden met MBS in Jeddah, where they exchanged a fist-bump that made international headlines and defined what turned out to be a chilly visit.</p></span><br /></div>

				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>This week, Saudi and Chinese state media have been eager to highlight their governments&apos; close ties. Saudi state television aired clips of previous meetings between Chinese and Saudi officials, narrating the two countries&apos; warm relationship, which they claim dates back more than eight decades.</p><p>Xi stated in a signed article published Thursday in the Saudi newspaper Al Riyadh that his visit to the kingdom this week will &quot;herald in a new era in China&apos;s relations with the Arab world, Arab states of the Gulf, and Saudi Arabia.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The Arab world is an important member of the developing world and a key force in upholding international fairness and justice,&quot; Xi wrote, adding that &quot;the Arab people value independence, oppose external interference, oppose power politics and high-handedness, and always seek progress.&quot;</p><p>In the article titled &quot;Carrying Forward Our Millenia-old Friendship and Jointly Creating a Better Future,&quot; Xi said that China and Arab states will &quot;continue to hold high the banner of non-interference in internal affairs, firmly support each other in safeguarding sovereignty and territorial integrity, and jointly uphold international fairness and justice,&quot; in a nod to US diplomacy, whose ties with the Saudis have crumbled over OPEC&apos;s decision to slash crude oil supply.</p><p>Saudi Arabia&apos;s energy minister also stated that Saudi-Chinese relations are &quot;taking a quantum leap&quot; and that the kingdom &quot;will remain China&apos;s credible and reliable partner&quot; in the oil sector, according to SPA.</p><p></span><br /></div>
