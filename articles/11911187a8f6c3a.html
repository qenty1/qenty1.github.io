				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>For the first time in nearly seven years, Chinese President Xi Jinping is visiting Saudi Arabia this week, where he is expected to sign billions of dollars in deals with the world&apos;s largest oil exporter and meet leaders from across the Middle East.</p><p>The visit demonstrates that China and the Gulf region are strengthening their economic ties at a time when US-Saudi relations have deteriorated due to OPEC&apos;s decision to cut crude oil supply. The trip, according to Xi in an article published in Saudi media, was intended to strengthen China&apos;s relations with the Arab world.</p><p>China is Saudi Arabia&apos;s largest trading partner and a growing source of investment. It is also the world&apos;s largest purchaser of oil. Saudi Arabia is China&apos;s largest trading partner in the Middle East and the world&apos;s largest crude oil supplier.</p><p>&quot;All discussions between the Saudi-Chinese leadership will center on energy cooperation,&quot; said Ayham Kamel, head of Eurasia Group&apos;s Middle East and North Africa research team. &quot;There is widespread recognition of the need to construct a framework to ensure that this interdependence is accommodated politically, particularly given the scope of the Western energy transition.&quot;</p><p>Governments all over the world have pledged to drastically reduce carbon emissions in the coming decades. Countries such as Canada and Germany have increased their investments in renewable energy to accelerate their transition to net-zero economies.</p><p>Since the 2000s, the United States has significantly increased domestic oil and gas output while also hastening its transition to clean energy.</p><p>Russia&apos;s February invasion of Ukraine triggered a global energy crisis, with all countries scrambling to shore up supplies. And the West has further disrupted the oil markets by imposing an embargo and price cap on the world&apos;s second largest crude exporter.</p></span><br /></div>

				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>Energy security is also becoming a top priority for China, which is dealing with significant challenges of its own. According to Chinese customs figures, bilateral trade between Saudi Arabia and China reached $87.3 billion last year, up 30% from 2020.</p><p>The majority of the trade was centered on oil. In 2021, China&apos;s crude imports from Saudi Arabia were $43.9 billion, accounting for 77% of the kingdom&apos;s total goods imports. This also accounts for more than a quarter of Saudi Arabia&apos;s total crude exports.</p><p>&quot;Stability of energy supplies, in terms of both prices and quantities, is a key priority for Xi Jinping as the Chinese economy remains heavily reliant on oil and natural gas imports,&quot; said Eswar Prasad, a professor of trade policy at Cornell University.</p><p>The world&apos;s second largest economy relies heavily on imported oil and gas. According to official figures, 72% of its oil consumption was imported last year. 44% of natural gas demand came from outside the country.</p><p>At the 20th Party Congress in October, Xi emphasized the importance of ensuring energy security. Following Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine, there has been a string of severe power outages and skyrocketing global energy prices.</p><p>As the West avoided Russian crude in the months following the invasion, China capitalized on Moscow&apos;s desperate search for new buyers. Between May and July, Russia was China&apos;s No. 1 oil supplier, until Saudi Arabia regained the top spot in August.</p><p></span><br /></div>
