				</div>
				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>On the Beach founder and CEO Simon Cooper will step down within the next year.</p><p>He will be succeeded by Shaun Morton, the finance chief. Cooper, who founded On the Beach in 2004 and is still a &quot;significant&quot; shareholder, having increased his stake in August, will continue to serve on the board as a non-executive founder director.</p><p>The announcement came as the OTA reported a return to profitability in the fiscal year ending September 30, with a pre-tax profit of 14.1 million compared to a loss of 18.4 million the previous year.</p><p>However, the profit was 20 million less than the 34.5 million figure achieved prior to the pandemic.</p><p>Despite the emergency of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 at the start of the year, which disrupted airline schedules, the company said average booking values rose by 31% over 2019 levels, with a greater mix of long-haul, B2B, and premium beach holidays.</p><p>The company&apos;s trade-only Classic tour operating businesses had a record year.</p><p>&quot;As travel re-emerged from nearly two years of restrictions in February,&quot; Cooper said, &quot;Classic Collection and Classic Package were both well-positioned to deliver growth.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Despite the slow restart following Omicron and the number of captive customers of competitors who had rolled cancelled holidays from Covid-19 disrupted periods, the combined Classic businesses delivered a 45% increase in TTV versus 2019.</p><p>&quot;Andy Freeth was appointed as the new CEO of Classic Collection Holidays and Classic Package Holidays in October 2022. Andy has extensive experience in tour operations and leading B2B businesses through rapid expansion.</p></span><br /></div>

				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>&quot;Andy is an experienced CEO who is thrilled to be joining Classic and eager to support the company&apos;s ambitious future growth plans. Cooper called 2022 a year of &quot;strategic progress&quot; for the company.</p><p>&quot;Despite a number of well-documented headwinds faced by the entire industry, including the disruption caused by Omicron during the key booking period of January,&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;This success is largely due to the investments we have made in our brand, technology, and customer proposition over the last 12 months.&quot; Cooper also added: &quot;Throughout the year, we developed a truly differentiated customer proposition, successfully positioning the brand to appeal to customers looking for five-star bookings on both short and long-haul flights, resulting in the group capturing a larger share of the market&apos;s premium segment.</p><p>&quot;Our industry-first, customer-focused initiatives, such as our free lounge and fast-track security offers, have improved the customer experience and distinguished us from our competitors.</p><p>&quot;We are excited to expand this premium offering while also expanding our long haul and B2B offerings, which will significantly increase our total addressable market.&quot;</p><p>He stated: &quot;Given the challenging macroeconomic environment, the future of the UK outbound travel industry remains uncertain.</p><p>&quot;While winter, particularly January, remains a critical trading period for us, we have begun the new fiscal year with a healthy forward order book for summer 2023.</p><p>&quot;Fortunately, 2023 will also be the first year our industry is free of refund credit notes and vouchers, which will significantly increase our captive audience, and I am confident that the investments we have made this year have placed us in an excellent position for the year ahead.</p><p></span><br /></div>
