				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>A look inside Exeter&apos;s new 40 million Hotel Indigo, which is replacing the former House of Fraser store, reveals that it is nearly finished. Although an exact opening date has yet to be determined, the luxury boutique hotel, which will include a restaurant, bars, and spa complex, as well as a High Street shopping parade, is expected to welcome its first guests soon.</p><p>The 104-room hotel will have a corner entrance from St Catherine&apos;s Square. A sneak peek was obtained through the open doors of its ground-floor restaurant, which faces Catherine Street. The former Colson&apos;s original sign, which was discovered at the front of the building when renovations began, is now proudly displayed above a swanky-looking bar area, paying homage to the building&apos;s historic past.</p><p>Colson&apos;s is an apt name for the restaurant. Visitors can also look forward to its rooftop bar, which offers panoramic views of the cathedral and the city. Developers stated in September 2021 that the hotel would be completed within the year. Its website, however, simply states &apos;coming soon,&apos; and no date has been confirmed to DevonLive.</p><p>For over 200 years, the store has been a part of Exeter&apos;s history. Widow Mrs. Colson, a milliner, established the shop in 1792. It was later renamed Dingles before being renamed House of Fraser. It survived the Blitz, has been re-branded and refurbished, and was Exeter&apos;s first store to install an escalator.</p><p>Rebecca Coonan, the hotel&apos;s new general manager, was announced this week. Hotel Indigo Exeter, which is owned by Hotel Exe Limited, will be managed by Castlebridge Hospitality, which already manages three UK Hotel Indigo properties: Hotel Indigo Bath, Hotel Indigo Chester, and Hotel Indigo Stratford upon Avon.</p><p>&quot;It is extremely exciting to be a part of Hotel Indigo Exeter and to work for such a fantastic brand,&quot; Rebecca said. I want Hotel Indigo Exeter to be the best place in this amazing, vibrant city to stay, drink, eat, and relax.</p></span><br /></div>

				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>&quot;We are excited to open our doors and show off this magnificent hotel and what we have accomplished in its transformation.&quot;</p><p>The conversion of the building into a hotel is thought to have been inspired by key elements of Exeter&apos;s history, such as The House That Moved, Colson&apos;s department store, and the Cathedral Heritage. One-fifth of the former store was demolished, mostly to make way for a lightwell through the center, which opened up the previously dark interior, including the central escalator and stairways.</p><p>The hotel will have seven luxurious presidential suites. Bookings do not appear to be available on the hotel&apos;s website at this time.</p><p>On the ground floor, four large shopping units, Colson&apos;s Parade, will face the High Street. It has not been determined who will occupy them.</p><p>Joe Priday is the managing director of Plaza Properties Limited, which purchased the 70,000 square foot space for an undisclosed sum in February 2020.</p><p></span><br /></div>
