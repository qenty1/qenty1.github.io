				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>MSC Cruises used the launch of its newest cruise ship, the MSC Seascape, to highlight the company&apos;s growing commitment to the New York and United States cruise markets. The cruise line, which was founded 30 years ago, now claims to be the fastest-growing cruise brand, with a fleet of 21 cruise ships and two more under construction.</p><p>The MSC Seascape, the last of four cruise ships built for MSC by Fincantieri, is also the largest cruise ship built in Italy, along with her sister ship, the MSC Seaview. The vessels are based on Fincantieri&apos;s revolutionary design, which increases revenue and passenger space while also increasing outdoor deck space. The design repositions the ship&apos;s primary weight, the engine spaces, to midships, and the balanced weight repositioning provides greater structural and hydrodynamic efficiency.</p><p>The MSC Seascape and her sister ship are part of the Seaside Evo Class, which is 11 percent larger than the first ships in the class, which were launched in 2017 and 2018. The ships have a gross weight of 170,412 tons and 2,270 passenger cabins. The MSC Seaside features the largest private suite enclave, known as the MSC Yacht Club, with 131 suites, making it the largest on any MSC cruise ship. There is a maximum passenger capacity of 5,877.</p><p>&quot;We have ambitious growth plans in the United States, and New York City is an important part of that,&quot; said Ruben Rodriguez, President of MSC Cruises USA. He mentions that the MSC Meraviglia will launch the company&apos;s first year-round cruises from New York in April 2023. MSC will position the MSC Seascape for year-round sailing from Miami beginning in the winter of 2023-2024, and it will be joined by three other ships for MSC&apos;s largest ever deployment in North America beginning in the winter of 2023-2024. The cruise line says it is nearly doubling its capacity in the United States.</p><p>NYC Mayor Eric Adams welcomes MSC to New York City (Allan Jordan)</p></span><br /></div>

They took advantage of the opportunity to highlight their philanthropic work through the MSC Foundation, as well as the company&apos;s environmental focus, both for its ships and to fulfill founder Captain Gianluigi Aponte&apos;s vision of creating a better world for future generations. They highlighted their charitable work around the world, including a $236,000 donation to the New York City Parks GreenThumb Program and the New York City Junior Ambassador program announced today.</p><p>The evening featured a parade of the new cruise ship&apos;s officers as well as a musical performance by Italian singing sensation Mateo Bocelli. Godmother for all of MSC&apos;s cruise ships famed actress Sophia Loren made an appearance by video due to the pandemic to bless the ship while Alexa Aponte Vago performed the honors of releasing the champagne bottle christening the new cruise ship.</p><p>MSC celebrated the naming of its newest cruise ship in New York City to highlight the company&apos;s growing presence in the United States (Allan Jordan)</p><p>The MSC Seascape offers numerous amenities to its passengers, including 11 dining options and 20 bars and lounges. The ship also has six swimming pools as well 140,000 square feet of outdoor deck space, including 1,772-foot long promenades and a glass walkway 16 decks above the ocean.</p><p></span><br /></div>
