				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>Drivers heading north in Draper should be aware of a massive oil spill that closed the freeway overnight and will take at least until mid-morning to clean up.</p><p>Due to the incident, the drive from Provo to Sandy, which usually takes less than 30 minutes via I-15, took more than three hours. Drivers are encouraged to postpone their commute if possible until the area has been cleaned up.</p><p>&quot;They&apos;re looking at a partial closure after that midmorning opening right now, so hopefully crews can make some good progress and clear that all up,&quot; said Utah Highway Patrol Sgt. Cameron Roden.</p><p>According to UHP, no wrong-way ramp use will be permitted for drivers to turn around, and drivers are also not permitted to park or abandon their vehicles on the shoulder. According to UHP, the shoulders are only for emergency use and may cause additional problems.</p><p>The accident happened around 11:15 p.m. Wednesday on I-15 Northbound at 14600 South. According to the Utah Highway Patrol, the incident involved at least six vehicles, including semi-trucks.</p><p>The major traffic event began when an Amazon semi-truck jackknifed on the freeway, forcing a passenger vehicle to merge over to avoid the crashed truck.</p><p>At the same time, a semi-truck carrying two tankers of crude oil was driving too fast for the conditions on the freeway and lost control, colliding with the back of the Amazon truck.</p><p>In addition, an SUV was disabled after colliding with debris from the crashes, according to UHP.</p></span><br /></div>

				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>Despite the chaotic crash, no injuries were reported, according to UHP.</p><p>I-15 northbound was closed at 14600 South while multiple agencies worked to clean up, and it is expected to remain closed until at least 7 a.m.</p><p>Drivers can access Bangerter Highway via frontage roads northbound after exiting at exit 288. Drivers can rejoin I-15 from there.</p><p>Officials warned that drivers should have plenty of fuel in their car and other emergency items if it&apos;s absolutely essential to travel through the area. They requested patience as numerous crews worked to clean up the mess.</p><p>According to UHP, there were dozens of other crashes across the Wasatch Front overnight due to weather conditions. In total, about 100 crashes were reported with 40-45 Thursday morning. According to officials, speed was a factor in the majority of the crashes.</p><p>Drivers are advised to slow down on slick roads caused by ice and snow.</p><p></span><br /></div>
